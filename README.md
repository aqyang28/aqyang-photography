Hello there, welcome to summer project where I practice website development by making something meaningful to me: a photography portfolio!

## 1. Introduction and Motives:
This project is a personal photography showcase website that merges my passions for programming and photography. Over the summer of 2025, I was looking to improve my skillset by learning web development. I stumbled upon [The Odin Project's JavaScript pathway](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript), and it has helped me strengthen my understanding of programming fundamentals, Git, and modern development practices. Ready to apply my learning outside of their guided projects, I began working on this photography portfolio website. Following an Agile-inspired incremental development approach, I focused my initial efforts on creating a minimal but functional home page. I iteratively added new features, sections, and design improvements to make efficient progress through the project.
